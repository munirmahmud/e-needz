        In case of any cancellations of any order(s) due to inevitable
        circumstances, the paid amount would be refunded to the customer via
        Bkash or Bank account, whatever they find convenient. Customers need to
        inform E-needz about the refund request via email, phone call, or
        web/app support.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the order gets canceled, then the customer will get refunded with
        his/her paid amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        The refund process may take up to 30 working days or more depending upon
        the payment service gateway provider’s clauses. The refund will be
        initiated within the same payment channel i.e. if the customer pays via
        Bkash then the customer will be refunded through Bkash. The customer
        cannot be refunded via any other payment channels. But E-needz retains
        the right and has the right to consider/reconsider refund via another
        flexible channel(s) to make the refund system faster or to make it
        easier for the customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The customer will not be eligible for any extra bonus against his/her
        paid amount in case of refunds. E-needz is not bound to pay any kind of
        service charge or cost for the refunded amount.
